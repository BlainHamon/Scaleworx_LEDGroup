# Scaleworx_LEDGroup

Arduino library for managing collections of neopixels or dotstar pixels

This library was born of a project where the LEDs did not necessairly line up with the positions
in a simple manner. This is now extended to handle 8 by 8 neopixel and dotstar matrices, with
constant mappings to handle the orientation and position.
